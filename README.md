# startalk-showcase

This project is meant to showcase what the STARTALK students at [Marquette University's Summer 2024 Chinese STARTALK Program](https://www.marquette.edu/languages-literatures-cultures/startalk-program-overview.php) have learned in their computer courses. Over the course of the past three weeks and in addition to Chinese language instruction, these students have been exposed to various STEM concepts such as 3D Modeling using Blender, Web Design using HTML and CSS, and Text Analysis in English and Chinese using R.
