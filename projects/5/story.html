    　　    牛郎翻山越岭，走了很远的路，终于找到了那头有病的老牛，他看到老牛病得厉害，就去给老牛打来一捆捆草，一连喂了三天，老牛吃饱了，才抬起头告诉他：自己本是天上的灰牛大仙，因触犯了天规被贬下天来，摔坏了腿，无法动弹。自己的伤需要用百花的露水洗一个月才能好，牛郎不畏辛苦，细心地照料了老牛一个月，白天为老牛采花接露水治伤，晚上依偎在老年身边睡觉，到老牛病好后，牛郎高高兴兴赶着十头牛回了家。回家后，嫂子对他仍旧不好，曾几次要加害他，都被老牛设法相救，嫂子最后恼羞成怒把牛郎赶出家门，牛郎只要了那头老牛相随。一天，天上的织女和诸仙女一起下凡游戏，在河里洗澡，牛郎在老牛的帮助下认识了织女，二人互生情意，后来织女便偷偷下凡，来到人间，做了牛郎的妻子。织女还把从天上带来的天蚕分给大家，并教大家养蚕，抽丝，织出又光又亮的绸缎。牛郎和织女结婚后，男耕女织，情深意重，他们生了一男一女两个孩子，一家人生活得很幸福。但是好景不长，这事很快便让天帝知道，王母娘娘亲自下凡来，强行把织女带回天上，恩爱夫妻被拆散。

            <p>The story of “The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl,” also known as “The Legend of the Milky Way,” is a beautiful Chinese folk tale that dates back thousands of years. In ancient China, there was a young cowherd named Niu Lang who lived a simple and humble life. He spent his days tending to his cattle and found solace in the serene beauty of the countryside. One day, while Niu Lang was herding his cows near a heavenly river, he witnessed an extraordinary sight. A group of celestial maidens, known as the Seven Fairy Sisters, descended from the heavens to bathe in the river. Among them was the youngest and most graceful maiden named Zhi Nu, also known as the Weaver Girl. Niu Lang was captivated by Zhi Nu’s beauty and gentle nature. He couldn’t help but fall deeply in love with her. Determined to make her his wife, Niu Lang hatched a plan. As the fairies bathed, he quietly approached the riverbank and stole Zhi Nu’s clothes, leaving her unable to return to the heavens. When Zhi Nu finished bathing and discovered her clothes were missing, she became distressed. Niu Lang then revealed himself, expressing his love for her and his desire to marry her. Touched by his sincerity and enchanted by his devotion, Zhi Nu agreed to become his wife, and they were married in a simple ceremony. For several years, Niu Lang and Zhi Nu lived a blissful life together. Niu Lang continued to tend to his cattle, while Zhi Nu used her celestial weaving skills to create exquisite garments. They cherished each other’s company and nurtured a deep love that grew with each passing day. They were blessed with two children, a boy and a girl, who brought immense joy to their lives. However, their happiness drew the attention of the Queen Mother of Heaven, ruler of the celestial realm. The Queen Mother was angered by Zhi Nu’s decision to marry a mortal and live on Earth. She summoned Zhi Nu back to the heavens, tearing her away from her beloved husband and children. Niu Lang was devastated by the sudden separation from his wife. He pleaded with the heavens to allow him to be reunited with Zhi Nu, but his cries fell on deaf ears. Determined to find his way back to his beloved, Niu Lang received a visit from an old, wise ox. The ox revealed itself to be a celestial being and offered Niu Lang a magical solution. It told him to kill it and use its hide to fashion a pair of flying sandals. Niu Lang followed the ox’s instructions, crafting the flying sandals from its hide. With the sandals on his feet and his children in woven baskets on his back, Niu Lang embarked on a daring journey to the heavens to rescue his wife. As he soared through the skies, Niu Lang encountered various celestial obstacles, including the Queen Mother’s guards. However, his determination and love for Zhi Nu fueled his courage, and he pressed on. Finally, he arrived at the heavenly realm and was reunited with his wife. Niu Lang and Zhi Nu embraced, their tears of joy flowing freely. Their love moved the heavens, and the Queen Mother softened her heart. She granted them permission to reunite once a year on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. However, their reunion came with a condition. Niu Lang and Zhi Nu could only meet across a vast river of stars, known as the Milky Way. The river was formed by the tears of the Seven Fairy Sisters, who empathized with their longing for each other. Each year, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, magpies from all over the world would gather, forming a bridge with their wings across the Milky Way. Niu Lang and Zhi Nu would cross the bridge, and for one precious day, they would be able to hold each other, sharing their love and cherishing their reunion. This day became known as Qi Xi, or the Qixi Festival, also called Chinese Valentine’s Day. It is a time when couples express their love and exchange gifts, and young girls pray to Zhi Nu, the Weaver Girl, for skills in needlework and finding true love. “The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl” is not only a story of love and devotion but also a tale that celebrates the power of true love to overcome even the greatest obstacles. It reminds us that love knows no boundaries and can transcend the mortal and celestial realms. The legend has been passed down through generations, capturing the hearts of people and inspiring them to believe in the enduring power of love.</p>
