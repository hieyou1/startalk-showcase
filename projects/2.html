    <div id="story">
        <p>Once upon a time in the Mountain <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="E-Mei">峨眉</span>, there were two snakes, <span data-bs-title="Bai She (White Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">白蛇</span> and <span data-bs-title="Hei She (Black Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">黑蛇</span>, both with magical power. <span data-bs-title="Bai She (White Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">白蛇</span> changed into a very beautiful girl named <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span>. <span data-bs-title="Hei She (Black Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">黑蛇</span> also became a lovely maid named <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span>. They came to <span data-bs-title="West Lake of Hang Zhou" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">西湖杭州</span> for a visit and were attracted by the beauty of the scene. There, over the <span data-bs-title="Duan-Qiao bridge" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">段家桥</span> came a young man named <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span>. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> immediately fell into love. To help her sister, <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> set some tricks to let <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> and <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng">白素贞</span> meet and finally get married. </p>
        <p>When the three-attendee wedding ceremony was on, the Abbot, named <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span>, of a remote Buddhist temple, <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Jin Shan (Golden Mountain) temple">金山寺</span>, sensed something and then found what was going on. He pledged to capture the <span data-bs-title="Bai She (White Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">白蛇</span>.</p>
        <p>After the marriage, the three of them moved to <span data-bs-title="Zhenjiang City" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">镇江市</span> on the <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Yangtse River">长江</span> where they set up a <span data-bs-title="herbal medicine store" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">草药店</span>. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> wrote out the prescriptions while <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> and <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> gathered and dispensed the herbal medicine. Patients unable to pay were given free treatment and medicine. The store quickly became well known and popular.</p>
        <p><span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> found <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> there and warned him that his pregnant wife was a snake. He showed <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> a way to reveal his wife's true self--a festival alcohol drink to give to her during <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Duan Wu Jie (Dragon Boat Festival)">端午节</span>. On that day, <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> bought the festival alcohol with realgar to celebrate and asked <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> to drink it with him. Under her husband's coaxing, <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> could not find a reason to refuse the drink and she took a sip, thinking that her superior magic skills would make her immune to the power of realgar. But she immediately was stricken ill and barely managed to get to bed. <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> rushed to the bed and drew aside its curtain. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> was no loger there. In her place was a large <span data-bs-title="Bai She (White Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">白蛇</span> coiled on the bed. So great was <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span>'s shock that he fell to the floor and died.</p>
        <p>When the power of realgar faded, <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> returned to her human form. She was heartbroken to find <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> lying dead beside the bed. But she knew that <span data-bs-title="ling zhi cao (glossy ganoderma)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">灵芝草</span>, a celestial herb on <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Kunlun Shan (Kunlun Mountain)">昆仑山</span>, could restore him to life. She flew to <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Kunlun Shan (Kunlun Mountain)">昆仑山</span> to steal the celestial herb but encountered the white crane and heavenly guards responsible for looking after the <span data-bs-title="ling zhi cao (glossy ganoderma)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">灵芝草</span>. They fought to prevent her from taking the herb and <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> was losing the battle. Suddenly, a voice commanded them to stop. It was the voice of the Immortal of the Southern End. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> begged him in tears to help her. Impressed by her sincerity and perseverance, he granted her the <span data-bs-title="ling zhi cao (glossy ganoderma)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">灵芝草</span>, and the life of <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> was restored. He suddenly remembered what the Abbot said to him. Recovered from the illness, <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> went to the Temple. To separate him from his wife, <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> forced him to become a monk. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span>, along with <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span>, ran to <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Jin Shan (Golden Mountain) temple">金山寺</span> and begged <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> to let her husband go but got refused. Then in anger, she gathered together a great army of underwater creatures to attack the monastery and used water to submerge the temple. <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> had a magic outer vestment, which made the mountain to grow so that the waterlevel was kept under the temple. <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> also had the magic to command heavenly soldiers. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> was pregnant, so could not fight the battle any longer.</p>
        <p><span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> and <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> fled to <span data-bs-title="West Lake of Hang Zhou" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">西湖杭州</span> to where they first met <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span>. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> was very angry at <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> for his unfaithfulness and pledged to kill him when she saw him. <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> was secretly released by a young monk when the two sides were fighting and happened to come to the same place. When they met him, <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> wanted to attack him with her sword, but <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> held her back and told <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> the truth. Now that they fully understood each other, they went home.</p>
        <p><span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> went to the heaven and asked the heaven emperor to help him. A powerful fighter with a magic lantern was commanded to assist <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span>. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> gave birth to a son. One day, <span data-bs-title="Xu Xian" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">许仙</span> went to buy a hat for his son. The hat he bought turned out to be a lantern which made <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> under the spell of the fighter. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> was then imprisoned under the <span data-bs-title="Lei Feng Ta (Thunder Peak Pagoda)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">雷峰塔</span> by <span data-bs-title="West Lake of Hang Zhou" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">西湖杭州</span>. <span data-bs-title="Hei She (Black Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">黑蛇</span> fled to her original place and practiced her magic. Several years later, her magic was strong enough to take revenge. She managed to destroy the <span data-bs-title="Lei Feng Ta (Thunder Peak Pagoda)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">雷峰塔</span> and rescued <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span>, allowing <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bai Su-Zheng (Lady White)">白素贞</span> to reunite with her husband and her son. <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Xiao Qing">小青</span> or <span data-bs-title="Hei She (Black Snake)" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">黑蛇</span> then defeated <span data-bs-title="Fa Hai" data-bs-toggle="tooltip">法海</span> and had him swallowed by a crab, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
