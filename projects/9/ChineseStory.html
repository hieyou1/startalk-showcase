            <h1 style=text-align:center>牛郎和织女的故事</h1>
            <p>从前，有一个英俊的年轻牛郎，名叫牛郎。他和哥哥嫂子住在一起。嫂子嫉妒他，对他很不好。每天，他都要从早到晚干苦活，天不亮就起床，挑水、生火、做饭、洗衣服，还要每天放他哥哥的水牛。他从来都吃不饱，而他那残忍的嫂子给他布置了许多不可能完成的任务。一天，嫂子把牛郎叫到身边，对他说：“今天你放水牛出去的时候，一定要把十头水牛都带回家，否则就别再回来了。”由于哥哥只有九头水牛，牛郎意识到自己被抛弃在世上了。牛郎沉浸在悲伤之中，在乡间的森林和山间徘徊，只有他的水牛陪伴着他，徒劳地寻找第十头水牛，这样他就可以回到他唯一的家。他绝望地倒在一棵树下，又饿又想家。就在他快要放弃希望的时候，一位白须飘飘的老人走到他面前，温柔地问他说：“年轻人，你有什么忧愁呢？”</p>
            <p>“牛郎回答说：“我哥哥给了我九头水牛，并告诉我，没有十头水牛就不要回来。”老人笑了笑，说：“你不要难过，我知道在第七座山的那边，第七座森林里，有一头老水牛，它受伤了，有病了，你只要喂养它，照料它，治好它，它就会跟你回来的。”牛郎于是擦干眼泪，出发去寻找老水牛。他走遍了密林，翻过了高山，终于找到了老水牛。老水牛受伤了，病得很重，牛郎悉心照料它，用最新鲜的草喂养了它三天。第三天，水牛开口说：“我曾经是水牛星，因为得罪了天王，所以从天上被打到了人间。我的伤口只能靠百花上的露珠在月亮转圆的时间内愈合。”牛郎对水牛心怀怜悯，不怕辛苦，每天采百花上的露珠，一连采了一个月，晚上就睡在水牛的身边，一连一个月。最后，水牛终于恢复了健康，牛郎欢天喜地把十头水牛赶回家。</p>
            <p>牛郎回到家，嫂子只好又把他收留了。然而嫂子对他更加残忍，让他从早到晚干苦活，每天天不亮就起床，挑水、生火、做饭、洗衣、放牧水牛。然而，牛郎很高兴，因为他有老水牛作伴，老水牛给他讲了许多奇妙的故事。一天，老水牛说：“牛郎，你是个善良有德的年轻人，我希望你幸福。天王有七个女儿，最小的一个最有才华，也最漂亮。今天你到小溪边去，把那件最红的仙女衣拿来，她就做你的妻子。”牛郎按照水牛的吩咐，走到小溪边。在那里，他看到七个美丽的仙女在洗澡，又看到了最小的仙女，她是多么美丽，他把她那件最红的仙女衣藏了起来。仙女们看到牛郎和老牛后，纷纷穿上仙女衣裳飞走了，但天王的小女儿却飞不走。牛郎走到她身边，和蔼地问她：“这是你的仙女衣裳，我会把它送给你，但你首先必须答应做我的妻子。”天王的小女儿织女，她的名字意为“织女”，因为她编织了天上的布。她看着英俊的年轻牛郎，同意了。</p>
            <p>随着时间的推移，牛郎和织女的爱意越来越深。牛郎放牛耕田，织女则在小茅屋里织出美丽、奢华的布匹。在故事的一些版本中，织女向村民传授了织丝的秘诀。天长日久，织女生下一儿一女，一家人过着幸福的生活。然而，天王发现天空的颜色不再像以前那么美丽，便让母亲王母娘娘去寻找失踪的女儿。王母娘娘看到幸福的一家人，又看到织女向村民传授织布的秘诀，勃然大怒。她决心召集天上的大军，把织女从牛郎手中抢走，强迫她重新织出天上的布匹。</p>
            <p>这时，老水牛对牛郎说：“牛郎，你这辈子对我很好。现在我要死了，你把我的皮剥下来做一双鞋，有了皮你就能飞了。”牛郎伤心欲绝，但还是同意了水牛皮。就这样，水牛放弃了灵魂，全家人都为失去好朋友而悲痛不已。织女知道水牛预感到了可怕的事情，她战战兢兢地等待着王母娘娘的到来。</p>
            <p>王母娘娘一怒之下，带着天兵下凡，在织女的丈夫和孩子的哭泣声中，把织女从草堂里抢到了天上。牛郎把水牛皮割成鞋，扛着两个桶，每个桶里装一个孩子，跟着她飞上了云霄。牛郎跑得像风一样快，鞋子把他带到了天上。他离织女越来越近，直到他们只有一掌之隔，织女向他们伸出了手。这时，王母娘娘抛下了冠冕，冠冕化为一条浩瀚的星河，永远地隔开了这对恋人。牛郎隔着河看织女，织女隔着河看牛郎，这条河就是我们所说的星河，或者银河。如果你在夜晚仰望天空，你会看到牛郎和织女，两颗位于河流两岸的星星，如果你仔细观察，你会看到牛郎星旁边有两颗较小的星星：他们是他们的儿子和女儿。</p>
            <p>世间的喜鹊被牛郎和织女的真情所感动，决定每年七月七日在星河上搭一座桥，让这对恋人和他们的孩子重逢。因此，在七月七日很难找到喜鹊，因为它们都飞到天上去，好让牛郎和织女飞到它们的翅膀上。我们世人都知道，如果七月七日晚上下雨，那雨就是这对幸福恋人的眼泪。</p>

                x.innerHTML = "<h1 style=text-align:center>The Cowherd and Weaver Girl</h1><p>Once upon a time, there was a handsome young cowherd called Niu Lang. He lived with his elder brother and sister-in-law, who was jealous of him and treated him badly. Every day, he had to do hard work from morning to night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash, and every day he had to herd his brother’s water buffalos. He never had enough to eat, and his cruel sister-in-law set him many impossible tasks. One day, the sister-in-law called Niu Lang to her, and said, “Today, when you go out with the water buffalos, be sure to bring all ten of them home, or never come back again.” Since his brother only had nine water buffalos, Niu Lang realized he was being thrown out into the world. Steeped in sorrow, Niu Lang wandered the forests and mountains of the countryside, with only his water buffalos for company, looking in vain for a tenth water buffalo so he may return to the only home he has known. In despair, he collapsed under a tree, sick with hunger and homesickness. Just as he was about to give up hope, an old man with a flowing white beard came up to him, and asked him gently, “Young man, what are your sorrows?”</p><p>“My brother gave me nine water buffalos, and has told me not to come back until I have ten,” Niu Lang replied. The old man smiled, and said, “Don’t be sad, for I know that over the seventh mountain and in the seventh forest there is an old water buffalo who is wounded and sick, and if you feed him, tend him and cure him, he will come back with you.” So Niu Lang dried his tears, and set out to find the old water buffalo. He traveled far and wide through the thick forests and through the high mountains, and finally found the old water buffalo. The old water buffalo was wounded and very ill, and Niu Lang tended him, feeding him for three days with the freshest grass he could find. On the third day, the water buffalo opened his mouth and said, “I was once the water buffalo star, but because I offended the king of heaven, I was thrown down from heaven to earth. My wound can only be healed by the dewdrops on a hundred flowers for the time it takes for the moon to become round again.” Niu Lang was filled with compassion for the water buffalo, and did not mind hard work, and so he collected t   dew from a hundred flowers for every day for a month, and slept by the water buffalo’s side every night for a month. At last, the water buffalo was nursed back to health, and Niu Lang joyfully herded all ten water buffalos home.</p><p>When Niu Lang reached home, his sister-in-law had no choice but to take him in again. Yet, she was even more cruel to him, making him do hard work from morning to night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash and herd the water buffalos every day. However, Niu Lang was happy, for he had the company of the old water buffalo, who told him marvellous stories. One day, the old water buffalo said, “Niu Lang, you are a good and virtuous young man, and I want to see you happy. The king of heaven has seven daughters, and the youngest is the most talented and beautiful. Go to the stream today, and take the fairy robe of brightest red, and she will be your wife.” Niu Lang followed the water buffalo’s instructions, and went down to the stream. There he saw seven beautiful fairies bathing, and he saw the youngest fairy, and how beautiful she was, and he hid her fairy robe of brightest red. When the fairies saw Niu Lang and the old buffalo, they put on their fairy robes and flew away, but the youngest daughter of the king of heaven could not fly away. Niu Lang approached her and asked her kindly, “Here is your fairy robe – I will give it to you, but first, you must promise to be my wife.” The youngest daughter, Zhi Nǚ, whose name means Weaver Girl, for she wove the cloth of the sky, looked at the handsome young cowherd and agreed.</p><p>As time went on, Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ fell in deeper and deeper love with each other. He tended the buffalos and ploughed the fields, while she wove beautiful, luxurious cloths in their small thatched cottage. In some versions of the story, Zhi Nǚ taught the villagers the secret art of weaving silk. In the fullness of time, Zhi Nǚ gave birth to a son and a daughter, and the small family lived a blissful life together. However, the king of heaven realized that the colours of the sky were not as beautiful as before, and he asked his mother, Wang Mu Niang Niang, to look for his missing daughter. Wang Mu Niang Niang saw the happy family, and saw how Zhi Nǚ had taught the villagers the secret art of weaving, and flew into a rage. She was determined to gather the forces of heaven to snatch Zhi Nǚ away from Niu Lang, and to force her to weave the cloth of the sky again.</p><p>Just then, the old water buffalo said to the cowherd, “Niu Lang, you have treated me well in this life. Now, I must die, and you must take my skin and make a pair of shoes out of them, for with my skin you will be able to fly.” Niu Lang was overcome with sorrow, but agreed to take the water buffalo’s skin. With that, the water buffalo gave up his spirit, and the whole family mourned the loss of their kind friend. Zhi Nǚ knew that the water buffalo had foreseen something terrible, and waited in fear for Wang Mu Niang Niang to find her.</p><p>Wang Mu Niang Niang descended from the heavens in her rage, accompanied by the forces of heaven, and snatched Zhi Nǚ from her cottage home into the sky to the sounds of her weeping husband and children. Niu Lang cut the water buffalo’s skin into a pair of shoes, and, balancing two pails on a rod on his shoulders, he put one child in each pail and ran up into the clouds after her. Niu Lang ran as fast as the wind, and the shoes bore him up into the heavens. He got closer and closer to Zhi Nǚ, until they were merely a hand’s breadth apart, and Zhi Nǚ reached out her hand to them. At that moment, Wang Mu Niang Niang threw down her diadem, and it changed into a vast river of stars, forever separating the two lovers. Niu Lang looked across the river at Zhi Nǚ; Zhi Nǚ looked across the river at Niu Lang – the river is what we call the Star River, or the Milky Way. If you look into the sky at night, you will see Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ, two stars on opposite sides of the river, and if you look closely, you will see two smaller stars by Niu Lang’s star: they are their son and daughter.</p><p>Moved by the true love of Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ, the magpies of the world decided to form a bridge across the Star River once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, so that the two lovers and their children may meet again. Thus it is very difficult to find a magpie on the seventh day of the seventh month, for they have all flown into the heavens so Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ may be borne on their wings. We on earth know that, if it rains on the seventh night of the seventh month, that rain is the tears of the happy lovers.</p>";
