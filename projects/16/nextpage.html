</body>

<body>
    All these stories contain themes of ill-fated love. The first 2 have themes of family rivaliry that prevents the union of the lovers while the last has honor and family name that seperates them. All the stories end with death with the two western stories placing the death as a product of hubris and a misunderstanding. The Chinese tale on the other hand places the death as a result of love and with purpose.
