            <h2>Chinese Version</h2>
            <t2 class="t2.one"> 在农历七月初七，也就是所谓的"中国情人节"，中国人庆祝牛郎和织女的爱情故事。这个故事有两个开始，一个在天堂，一个在人间。在故事的某些版本中，牛是天上的一颗星，名叫千牛，织女是另一颗星——两颗星都跨越了天界，爱上了对方，牛被扔到地上当穷牛，织女则悲哀地织着天上的布。在其他版本中，他们的爱首先发生在地球上:
                很久很久以前，有一个年轻英俊的牛郎。他和哥哥嫂子住在一起，哥哥嫂子嫉妒他，对他很不好。每天，他必须从早干到晚，天亮前起床，挑水，生火，做饭和洗衣服，每天他还要放牧他兄弟的水牛。他没有足够的食物，他残忍的嫂子给他许多不可能完成的任务。有一天，嫂子把牛郎叫到她面前，对她说: "今天你和水牛出去的时候，一定要把它们全部带回家，否则就再也不要回来了。"因为他的兄弟只有九头水牛，牛郎意识到他正在被抛弃到这个世界上。沉浸在悲伤中的牛郎在乡村的森林和山脉中游荡，只有他的水牛作伴，徒劳地寻找第十只水牛，这样他就可以回到他唯一知道的家。在绝望中，他倒在一棵树下，因为饥饿和思乡病倒了。正当他要放弃希望的时候，一个长着飘逸的白胡子的老人走到他面前，温柔地问他: "年轻人，你有什么烦恼吗?"
                牛郎回答说: "我哥哥给了我九头水牛，并告诉我十头之前不要回来。"。老人微笑着说: "不要难过，因为我知道在第七座山和第七片森林里有一头老水牛，它受了伤，生了病，如果你喂它，照顾它，治好它，它就会和你一起回来。"于是牛郎擦干眼泪，出发去寻找那头老水牛。他走了很远很远，穿过茂密的森林，穿过高山，最后找到了那头古老的水牛。老水牛受了伤，病得很重，牛郎照顾它，用他能找到的最新鲜的草喂了它三天。第三天，水牛开口说: "我曾经是水牛星，但是因为我冒犯了天上的王，我从天上掉到了地上。我的伤口只能靠一百朵花上的露珠来愈合，直到月亮再次变圆。"牛郎对水牛充满了同情，不介意辛苦劳作，所以他一个月里每天采集一百朵花的露水，一个月里每天晚上睡在水牛的身边。最后，水牛恢复了健康，牛郎高兴地把十头水牛赶回了家。
                当牛郎回到家里，他的嫂子别无选择，只能再次收留他。然而，她对他更加残忍，让他从早干到晚，天亮前起床，提水，生火，做饭，洗衣服，每天放水牛。然而，牛郎很高兴，因为他有老水牛的陪伴，老水牛给他讲了许多不可思议的故事。一天，老水牛说: "牛郎，你是一个善良的年轻人，我想看到你快乐。天王有七个女儿，最小的是最有才华最漂亮的。今天去小溪边，穿上鲜红色的仙女袍，她就是你的妻子。"牛郎听从水牛的指示，走到小溪边。在那里，他看到七个美丽的仙女沐浴，他看到最年轻的仙女，她是多么美丽，他隐藏了她最亮的红色仙女长袍。仙女们看见牛郎和老水牛，就穿上仙袍飞走了，可是天王的小女儿却飞不走。牛郎走近她，和蔼地问道:"这是你的仙袍——我会给你的，但是首先，你必须答应做我的妻子。"最小的女儿织女，织布的意思是织女，她织天空的布，看着英俊的年轻牛郎，表示同意。
                随着时间的推移，牛郎和织女相爱得越来越深。他照料水牛，耕地，而她则在他们的小茅屋里编织漂亮奢华的布匹。在这个故事的一些版本中，织女教给村民们织丝的秘密技艺。到了晚年，织女生了一儿一女，一家人幸福地生活在一起。然而，天王意识到天空的颜色不像以前那么美丽了，他让他的母亲王母娘娘去寻找他失踪的女儿。王母娘娘看到这个幸福的家庭，又看到知女教村民织布的秘法，大发雷霆。她下定决心，要聚集天上的力量，把织女从牛郎手中抢过来，逼她重新织布。
                就在这时，老水牛对牛郎说: "牛郎，你这一生对我很好。现在，我必须死了，你必须剥下我的皮，用它们做一双鞋，因为有了我的皮，你就能飞了。"牛郎悲痛欲绝，但还是同意剥了水牛的皮。就这样，水牛放弃了他的精神，全家人都为失去了他们的好朋友而悲伤。织女知道水牛预见了可怕的事情，害怕地等着王母娘娘去找她。
                王母娘娘怒气冲冲地从天而降，在丈夫和孩子们的哭声中，一把将知女从茅屋里抓到了天上。牛郎把水牛的皮割成一双鞋子，用肩膀上的杆子平衡两个水桶，每个水桶里放一个孩子，然后跟着她跑上云端。牛郎跑得像风一样快，鞋子把他托到了天上。他离织女越来越近，直到只有一只手的距离，织女才向他们伸出手来。就在这时，王母娘娘丢下了她的王冠，变成了一条浩瀚的星河，永远地分开了这对恋人。牛郎望着河对岸的 织女，织女望着河对岸的牛郎。这条河就是我们所说的星河，或者银河。如果你在夜晚仰望天空，你会看到牛郎和织女，两颗星在河的两边，如果你仔细看，你会看到牛郎的星旁边有两颗较小的星: 他们是他们的儿子和女儿。
                受到牛郎织女真爱的感动，天下的喜鹊们决定每年七月七日在星河上搭一座桥，让这对恋人和他们的孩子再见面。所以七月初七很难找到喜鹊，因为它们都飞到天上去了，这样就可以用翅膀载着牛郎和织女了。我们地球上的人都知道，如果七月七日晚上下雨，那么这场雨就是幸福的恋人的眼泪。

            <h2> English Translation </h2>
            <t2> On the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, what has been called the "Chinese Valentine's Day", the Chinese celebrate the love story of Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ. The story has two beginnings, one in heaven, and one on earth. In some versions of the story, Niu Lang was a star in heaven called Qian Niu, while Zhi Nǚ was another star – both stars transgress the boundary of heaven by falling in love with the other, and Niu Lang is thrown to earth to become a poor cowherd, while Zhi Nǚ is condemned to weave the cloth of the sky in sorrow. In other versions, their love first occurs on earth:
                Once upon a time, there was a handsome young cowherd called Niu Lang. He lived with his elder brother and sister-in-law, who was jealous of him and treated him badly. Every day, he had to do hard work from morning to night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash, and every day he had to herd his brother's water buffalos. He never had enough to eat, and his cruel sister-in-law set him many impossible tasks. One day, the sister-in-law called Niu Lang to her, and said, "Today, when you go out with the water buffalos, be sure to bring all ten of them home, or never come back again." Since his brother only had nine water buffalos, Niu Lang realized he was being thrown out into the world. Steeped in sorrow, Niu Lang wandered the forests and mountains of the countryside, with only his water buffalos for company, looking in vain for a tenth water buffalo so he may return to the only home he has known. In despair, he collapsed under a tree, sick with hunger and homesickness. Just as he was about to give up hope, an old man with a flowing white beard came up to him, and asked him gently, "Young man, what are your sorrows?"
                "My brother gave me nine water buffalos, and has told me not to come back until I have ten," Niu Lang replied. The old man smiled, and said, "Don't be sad, for I know that over the seventh mountain and in the seventh forest there is an old water buffalo who is wounded and sick, and if you feed him, tend him and cure him, he will come back with you." So Niu Lang dried his tears, and set out to find the old water buffalo. He traveled far and wide through the thick forests and through the high mountains, and finally found the old water buffalo. The old water buffalo was wounded and very ill, and Niu Lang tended him, feeding him for three days with the freshest grass he could find. On the third day, the water buffalo opened his mouth and said, "I was once the water buffalo star, but because I offended the king of heaven, I was thrown down from heaven to earth. My wound can only be healed by the dewdrops on a hundred flowers for the time it takes for the moon to become round again." Niu Lang was filled with compassion for the water buffalo, and did not mind hard work, and so he collected the dew from a hundred flowers for every day for a month, and slept by the water buffalo's side every night for a month. At last, the water buffalo was nursed back to health, and Niu Lang joyfully herded all ten water buffalos home.
                When Niu Lang reached home, his sister-in-law had no choice but to take him in again. Yet, she was even more cruel to him, making him do hard work from morning to night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash and herd the water buffalos every day. However, Niu Lang was happy, for he had the company of the old water buffalo, who told him marvellous stories. One day, the old water buffalo said, "Niu Lang, you are a good and virtuous young man, and I want to see you happy. The king of heaven has seven daughters, and the youngest is the most talented and beautiful. Go to the stream today, and take the fairy robe of brightest red, and she will be your wife." Niu Lang followed the water buffalo's instructions, and went down to the stream. There he saw seven beautiful fairies bathing, and he saw the youngest fairy, and how beautiful she was, and he hid her fairy robe of brightest red. When the fairies saw Niu Lang and the old buffalo, they put on their fairy robes and flew away, but the youngest daughter of the king of heaven could not fly away. Niu Lang approached her and asked her kindly, "Here is your fairy robe – I will give it to you, but first, you must promise to be my wife." The youngest daughter, Zhi Nǚ, whose name means Weaver Girl, for she wove the cloth of the sky, looked at the handsome young cowherd and agreed.
                As time went on, Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ fell in deeper and deeper love with each other. He tended the buffalos and ploughed the fields, while she wove beautiful, luxurious cloths in their small thatched cottage. In some versions of the story, Zhi Nǚ taught the villagers the secret art of weaving silk. In the fullness of time, Zhi Nǚ gave birth to a son and a daughter, and the small family lived a blissful life together. However, the king of heaven realized that the colours of the sky were not as beautiful as before, and he asked his mother, Wang Mu Niang Niang, to look for his missing daughter. Wang Mu Niang Niang saw the happy family, and saw how Zhi Nǚ had taught the villagers the secret art of weaving, and flew into a rage. She was determined to gather the forces of heaven to snatch Zhi Nǚ away from Niu Lang, and to force her to weave the cloth of the sky again.
                Just then, the old water buffalo said to the cowherd, "Niu Lang, you have treated me well in this life. Now, I must die, and you must take my skin and make a pair of shoes out of them, for with my skin you will be able to fly." Niu Lang was overcome with sorrow, but agreed to take the water buffalo's skin. With that, the water buffalo gave up his spirit, and the whole family mourned the loss of their kind friend. Zhi Nǚ knew that the water buffalo had foreseen something terrible, and waited in fear for Wang Mu Niang Niang to find her.
                Wang Mu Niang Niang descended from the heavens in her rage, accompanied by the forces of heaven, and snatched Zhi Nǚ from her cottage home into the sky to the sounds of her weeping husband and children. Niu Lang cut the water buffalo's skin into a pair of shoes, and, balancing two pails on a rod on his shoulders, he put one child in each pail and ran up into the clouds after her. Niu Lang ran as fast as the wind, and the shoes bore him up into the heavens. He got closer and closer to Zhi Nǚ, until they were merely a hand's breadth apart, and Zhi Nǚ reached out her hand to them. At that moment, Wang Mu Niang Niang threw down her diadem, and it changed into a vast river of stars, forever separating the two lovers. Niu Lang looked across the river at Zhi Nǚ; Zhi Nǚ looked across the river at Niu Lang – the river is what we call the Star River, or the Milky Way. If you look into the sky at night, you will see Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ, two stars on opposite sides of the river, and if you look closely, you will see two smaller stars by Niu Lang's star: they are their son and daughter.
                Moved by the true love of Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ, the magpies of the world decided to form a bridge across the Star River once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, so that the two lovers and their children may meet again. Thus it is very difficult to find a magpie on the seventh day of the seventh month, for they have all flown into the heavens so Niu Lang and Zhi Nǚ may be borne on their wings. We on earth know that, if it rains on the seventh night of the seventh month, that rain is the tears of the happy lovers.
