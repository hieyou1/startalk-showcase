        <h4>The rules, gameplay, and stratagy. Rules and gameplay, Chinese checkers is a simple game but a litle difrent from normal checkers the game board is like a hexagonal star so 2 people, 3 people, 4 people, and 6 people can plaay at a time and each person will have to move all of there ten peices to the side that is opposite from there starting side. You have to only move one space at a time but when you ar in line so you can jump another peace(that can be yours or another persons). When you jump a peice it dosnt get them out it just makes in faster to reache the other side of the board and after you land your jump ofer a peice if you are in line so that you can jump another peice you can jum peice until youcan not. Stratagy, you would want to setup a train of jumpable pieces praferably near the side of the board leading to your side and then just repeat untill the rest of you pices are at the other side of were you started.</h4>
